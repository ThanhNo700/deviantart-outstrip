"The antonym of Eclipse is Outstrip."

DA Outstrip is an experimental browser extension for bringing back the old DeviantArt interface. 99% of everyone hates the Eclipse, yet they aren't even finding a loophole, so I guess I had to do everything myself. Please thank me later, okay?

### How do I get it?
To begin the beta test, download my source files as ZIP. Then extract it and load them to Google. That's it for now. I might make a toggle switch later for user who wants to dual-browse both interfaces.

### Tell me about your versioning.
Here. MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH.DIARY (I can list down the meanings too, so read them below.)

MAJOR: We're focusing on just one API, so this increment would only need to be updated once this goes stable and live to the public.

MINOR: Once there are decent features to be included for the update, this can be incremented if all issues are solved.

PATCH: This is highly incremented for all bug fixes and patches, obviously.

DIARY: Doesn't really mean anything, basically a daily build. Perfect for helpers if forking Git is their style. Also the digits where I post DeviantArt's daily situations as a story on sleepless nights.
